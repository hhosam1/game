The game has 4 colored buttons: red, blue, green, and yellow.

At the start, the game lights up one color and plays its tone.

The player must press the same color button.

The game then adds one more color to the sequence.

The player must repeat the entire sequence in order.

Each round, the sequence gets longer by one color.

If the player presses the wrong color, the game ends (or restarts, depending on mode).

The goal is to remember and repeat the longest color sequence possible.
